# hackbcn-careerpath
A website for finding the jobs that are made for you just based on a picture of yourself.

Basically, you upload a picture of you on the website and get a description of several jobs that would suit you, with detailed explanations of the reasons why.

You can also select to have a playful tone for the answer, in order to have fun while exploring new career paths!

Feel free to play with the system, like this duck did.

If you want to be more serious about career exploration, you can also indicate your tastes and preferences to get even more personalized job recommendations.
