# hackbcn-careerpath
A website for finding the jobs that are made for you based on uploading a picture of yourself.

Basically, you upload a picture of you on the website and get a description of several jobs that would suit you, with detailed explanations of the reasons why.

You can also select to have a playful tone for the answer, in order to have fun while exploring new career paths!

Feel free to play with the system, like this duck does.
